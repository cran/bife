bife 0.3 (04.05.2017)

[Major Changes]

- Added a generic function `predict()`.
- Additional downgrades to ensure compability with g++ 4.4.x.
- Downgraded compiled code from C++11 to C++98. This ensures compability with older compilers.
- Removed jackknife bias-correction from `bife()` and `apeff_bife()`.
- `apeff_bife()` now uses the full sample instead of a sub-sample of indiviuals with a varying response.

[Minor Changes]

- Changed default argument `discrete` of `apeff_bife()` to `NULL`.
- Changed default argument `bias_corr` of `apeff_bife()` to `"ana"`. 

[Bug fix]

- Fixed an issue where `vcov()` was not able to distinguish between corrected and uncorrected coefficients.

bife 0.2 (20.02.2017)

[Major Changes]

- Added a function `fixed()` to model additional fixed-effects. See documentation for further details.
- Re-structured compiled code to optimize package size.
- Changed some function and argument names to common naming convention. For instance `apeff.bife(..., bias.corr = "ana")` is now `apeff_bife(..., bias_corr = "ana")`.
- Downgraded compiled code from C++11 to C++98. This ensures compability with older compilers.

[Minor Changes]

- Added comments and renamed variables such that they are in line with the notation of the corresponding working paper.
- Fixed some typos in documentation. 

[Bug fix]

- Fixed an issue where `bife()` was not able to fit a model with just one explanatory variable.
- Corrected computation of degrees of freedom.
